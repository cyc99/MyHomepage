# MyHomepage

Hi! This repo is to create my homepage to provide my personal portfolio.


## Language and Frameworks
**Javascript, React, CSS**

## Table of Contents
1. Main page (app.js)
2. About page (not yet)
3. Portfolio page (not yet)

## Main page (App.js)
I thought that animated text in the middle of center gives greater user experience.
So, I planned to implement the animated feature.

Known Bugs:
Since there is some delay time on every interval, text change doesn't work properly.
